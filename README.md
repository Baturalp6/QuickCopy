## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Excel file with catalog numbers in column B
- Access to source files directory
- Sufficient storage space in target directory

### Installation Options

#### 1. Pre-built Executables (Recommended)
You can find pre-built executables in the [Releases section](https://github.com/Baturalp6/QuickCopy/releases/tag/v1.0.0):
- **Windows**: Download `FileCopier.exe`
- **macOS**: Download `FileCopier.app` (Note: Due to cross-platform compilation limitations, macOS users might need to build from source)

#### 2. Build from Source
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Baturalp6/file-transfer-tool.git

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run application
python src/QuickCopy.py
```

## Usage Guide

1. Launch the application
2. Select source directory containing your files
3. Choose Excel file with catalog numbers (column B)
4. Select target directory for copied files
5. Click "Start" to begin the process

## Development

### Development Environment Setup
1. Install Python 3.x (tested with Python 3.9+)
2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas pyinstaller tkinter
```

### Building from Source

#### Windows (.exe)
```bash
# Basic version
python -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed --name "FileCopier" src/QuickCopy.py

# Advanced version with explicit dependencies
python -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed --hidden-import pandas --hidden-import tkinter --name "FileCopier" src/QuickCopy.py
```

#### macOS (.app)
```bash
python -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed --name "FileCopier" src/QuickCopy.py
```

## Important Notes

### Antivirus Warning
Some antivirus programs (e.g., Avast) might flag this application as suspicious. This is a common false positive that occurs with PyInstaller-generated executables because:

1. PyInstaller packages Python programs into standalone executables
2. This packaging method is sometimes used by malware creators
3. Antivirus software often flags unknown packed executables as suspicious

This is completely normal for custom-built applications and you can:
- Add the application to your antivirus whitelist
- Verify the source code and build it yourself
- Download only from this official repository

### Security
- This program only reads Excel files and copies files
- No internet connection required
- All operations are local to your computer
- Source code is open and can be audited

### Build Information
The Windows executable (.exe) is built on Windows 10 and tested on Windows 10/11.
For macOS users, it's recommended to build from source due to potential compatibility issues with pre-built apps.

### Latest Release
Check the [Releases page](https://github.com/Baturalp6/QuickCopy/releases/tag/v1.0.0) for:
- Pre-compiled executables
- Version history
- Change logs
- Installation instructions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Application won't start**
   - Verify admin privileges
   - Try restarting your system

2. **Excel file not recognized**
   - Ensure file format is .xlsx
   - Verify catalog numbers are in column B

3. **Files not found**
   - Check source directory
   - Verify file naming matches catalog numbers
